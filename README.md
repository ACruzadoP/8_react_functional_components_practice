This is 8th screencast, called "8. React Functional Components Practice"<br />
https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact

<br />
Objectives:<br />
1. Set up the basic React code from scratch<br />
2. Create a functional component called MyInfo that returns the following UI:<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. An h1 with your name<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. An ordered or unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit<br />
3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser<br />

<br />
Extra challenge: learn on your own (Google!) how you can add some style to your page.<br />
(This will also be covered in an upcoming lesson).<br />
