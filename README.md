This is 9th screencast, called "9. React Functional Components Practice"<br />
https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact


// Objectives:<br />
// 1. Set up the basic React code from scratch<br />
// 2. Create a functional component called MyInfo that returns the following UI:<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// a. An h1 with your name<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// c. An ordered or unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit<br />
// 3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser<br /><br />
// Extra challenge: learn on your own (Google!) how you can add some style to your page.<br />
// (We will also cover this in an upcoming lesson).<br />
